# base-binance-client

- the code use for Base hackathon only, shouldn't use it for production
- provide token info (candle, price, etc) from binance
- use port 8027 for default


## Prerequisites
- golang

## Run
- cd cmd && go run .

## Note
- we added some keys for easier running, it's quite bad to add keys to github, so we will revoke the keys soon after hackathon.
